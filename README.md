# TDD with React

A simple To Do application created as an example project for my article regarding Test Driven Development methodology.

The project was built using Vite, and the tests have been written by consuming packages, such as `vitest`, `@testing-library/react` and `@testing-library/jest-dom`.

## Usage

After cloning the repository, install the dependencies: `yarn install` or simply `yarn`.

To run the project: `yarn dev`

To run the tests: `yarn test`
